## Things yet to do:

* URL update / linkable states

* Tooltip hover for plots

  Esp. important for payments vs. income where we need to
  show bar divided by 12 (monthly average)

* Add a picker for common loans on the market

* Spin-ctrl for inputs in browsers without input[number] support

* Tolerate "20.000.000" input in inputs?

* IE support

* Add options to move the timeframe of playments

  This can then be used to get an overview of moving
  from one loan to another
